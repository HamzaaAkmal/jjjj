// lib/auth-edge.ts (Edge runtime compatible utilities)

// UserTokenPayload and verifyTokenEdge have been removed as they were part of the
// custom JWT authentication system which is no longer in use.
// This file is now empty but retained in case edge-specific auth utilities
// are needed in the future (e.g., for Firebase App Check or other services).
